# Retail-Store-Data-Analysis-with-Power-BI

## Introduction

This repository contains the data analysis project for a retail store using Power BI. The project includes visuals for four key questions posed by the CEO and CMO of the store. The visuals have been created in Power BI, providing insights and trends related to revenue, top-performing countries, top customers, and demand for products across various regions.

## Data Cleanup

Before starting the analysis, the data was cleaned to ensure accurate insights. The cleanup process involved:

- Checking and excluding negative quantities in returns.
- Filtering out unit prices below $0.

## Visuals

Each question has been addressed with a separate visual presented in a tab within the Power BI file (.pbix format). Below are the visuals corresponding to each question:

### Question 1: Time Series Revenue Analysis for 2011

The CEO wanted to view the time series of revenue data for the year 2011, with a granular view for each month. This visual helps to understand seasonal trends and supports forecasting for the next year.

### Question 2: Top 10 Revenue-Generating Countries

The CMO was interested in the top 10 countries generating the highest revenue. The visual also includes the quantity sold along with the revenue. The United Kingdom has been excluded from this analysis.

### Question 3: Top 10 Customers by Revenue

The CMO wanted to identify the top 10 customers generating the highest revenue. The visual is arranged in descending order, showcasing the customer with the highest revenue first and gradually declining to lower revenue-generating customers.

### Question 4: Demand Analysis by Region

The CEO sought insights on product demand across different regions. This visual shows regions with the highest demand, helping the CEO plan an expansion strategy to target areas with potential business opportunities. The United Kingdom has not been included in this analysis.
